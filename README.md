first find-out is the pointer into the rectangle or not?✅

now calculate that, are we in the right or left direction from the center ✅

now find out how far we are from the center of the rectangle

The farther away we are from the middle, the color intensity will be increase

//what did gsap.utils.mapRange(0,rectangular.width/2, 255, 0, cursorX) do?
// hare gsap.utils.mapRange is used to map the range of the cursorX to the range of the color value. first 0 is the minimum value of the cursorX, rectangular.width/2 is the maximum value of the cursorX, 255 is the maximum value of the color value, 0 is the minimum value of the color value, cursorX is the value of the cursorX. so it will map the value of the cursorX to the color value.
